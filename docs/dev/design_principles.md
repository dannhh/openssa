# A Design Principles

1. **Specialization Over Generalization:** Our models are designed to be domain-specific to provide precise solutions to specific problems, rather than providing generalized solutions.

2. **Efficiency and Speed:** We aim for our models to be faster and more efficient than large language models, making AI more accessible and cost-effective.

3. **Trustworthiness and Reliability:** As a foundation of industrial AI, our models are developed with an emphasis on robustness, reliability, and scalability.

4. **Collaborative Approach:** We believe in the power of combined intelligence. Our models can be deployed together to solve complex problems.

5. **Community-driven:** Our models are developed by the community, for the community. We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of their background or expertise.
